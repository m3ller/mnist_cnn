# mnist_cnn
## General Overview
A simple convlutional neural network to classify MNIST digits. The code 
includes functions to view the convolutions/pooling that occurs within the
network, and uses TensorBoard to track the loss.

## Network Overview
<!--Show pictures of results-->
Goes through two layers of convlution/max pooling.  Does a linear transformation.
Use cross entropy and minimize the loss with an Adam optimizer.
